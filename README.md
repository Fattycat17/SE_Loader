SurvivalEngine
===
SurvivalEngine (SE) is a powerful tool to manage big projects created with Lua. Its made for Roblox, but can also be used as standalone. It's designed for Lua 5.1.
Why?
---
It's extremely hard to manage big projects on Roblox. This doesn't only apply to games created with Roblox, but also big games only scripted with Lua. This Engine is created for Roblox, but it can also be used without it. Using this Engine, one can manage their creations with an extremely flexible and functional Class System, which supports a Parent/Children hierachy, on-the-fly Class editing and also adds hooks for an astonishingly useful debugger, which can trace almost every statement Lua is evaluating.

What?
---
A small feature overview:
1.Classes system which supports Inheritance, special non-primitive Properties. It also supports cloning and adds hooks to other operations.

2.System variable which is a Child/Parent-like data hierachy

3.Every Class extends a base class which has every "normal" Roblox Method in it

4.You can create events - which you can :connect and :disconnect.

5.Enums are also available to use

6.A waterproofed system: Users can never ever get direct access to classes or objects.

7.A very creative way of loading the system - A script of only 8 lines is needed, which will load everything for you.

8.You can define classes and scripts in seperate scripts - they will all be loaded at once, but you have a much better overview like his.
